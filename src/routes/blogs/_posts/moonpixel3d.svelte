I wrote about abandoning projects two weeks ago. This time I didn't abandon it.
</p>

<p>
I built <strong>MoonPixel3D</strong>. It's a 3D visualization of the solar system where 1 pixel = Moon's diameter (3,474.8 km). 
I saw Josh Worth's "If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel" and thought what if I can move around in 3D and 
actually navigate through space. So I made it.

At this scale Earth is 43,051 pixels from the Sun. Neptune is 1,293,488 pixels away. 
Even at light speed it takes 8 minutes to reach Earth and over 4 hours to reach Neptune. 
Space is really big and empty.
</p>

<p>
Built with C++20 and OpenGL 3.3+. Made procedural starfield in GLSL shaders so I don't have to load textures. 
You can travel at different speeds including light speed (86.26 pixels/s). Runs at 60+ FPS. 
Used ImGui for the UI and planet information.

Version 1.0 is done. It works. It has bugs and things I would change but it's finished.

<h2>Some technical things</h2>

<p>
Light speed calculation: 299,792.458 km/s รท 3,474.8 km/pixel = 86.26 pixels/second. 
This makes traveling feel real because even at light speed everything is slow.
</p>

<p>
Stars are generated in fragment shader using hash functions. No texture loading. Just math.

<p>
First project I actually finished. Maybe I can finish more things now.
