    I finally started making the menu page I abandoned. I didn't design it this time. I was looking for insipiration
    and saw the Menu Page from Hollow Knight. It was simple with just a beautiful background 
    and a few buttons. I do not have a beautiful background but I do have a few buttons.
    So I just moved into creating it. It does have bugs and it is not perfect but better than before. 
    At least I didn't change my OS. I even downloaded Obsidian to plan things and made
    a linear.app account to track progress and plan things
</p>

<p>
    I will keep updating this page as I make progress. I do not hope to finish it 
    but at least make it workable without bugs and I will also move on to creating 
    the start screen and characters and just things.
